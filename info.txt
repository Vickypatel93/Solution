Idea is to create databases for wx_data and yld_data separately.
and create table with the same name as file name in the respected database.

Provide the database credentials in config.py file and also in stats.py
We used MySQL for database.

Run -- go to folder code and type command python3 main.py
code for problem 1 and 2 is in file createdDatabase.py
code for problem 3 is in file stats.py
code for problem 4 is in main.py

1. Created two database(using MySQL server) names as the folder name(1. wx_data, 2. yld_data) and table name as the text file name(for example - USC00110072).
2. Creted result table in database "wx_data" for stats.
3. Keeping both the required data into data folder.
4. All the api's are in main.py, I have added sample result of stats in result folder.
